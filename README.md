# IGD Front End Test

## What is this?

For an application for a Junior Front End Developer Position at Interior Goods Direct Ltd, I was required to build a dynamic client side interface for a landing page where site visitors are able to get the price of their roller blind by entering a width and drop.

I used the React based Framework Next JS for serverside rendering, along with Tailwind CSS, Material UI and Styled Components for styling.
